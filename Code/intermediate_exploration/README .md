# Intermediate Exploration

This directory contains experimental work conducted between Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the project.

## Context
After identifying "Basic Object Focus" as the best template through CLIP score evaluation (Phase 1), this experimental phase was conducted to:
1. Test the winning template with real-world generation
2. Refine prompt engineering approaches
3. Generate a small set of test images (20)
4. Explore potential style variations

## Winning Template Refinements
The "Basic Object Focus" template was refined with specific requirements:
```python
REFINED_TEMPLATE = {
    "Basic Object Focus": {
        "description": "Enhanced single-plane arrangement optimizing object clarity and cognitive accessibility",
        "requirements": [
            "Place exactly 4 distinct objects (optimal for cognitive processing)",
            "Maintain 30% minimum spacing between objects",
            "Use solid-colored neutral background (light gray)",
            "Ensure maximum contrast between objects",
            "Position objects in a simple horizontal arrangement",
            "Scale objects to similar sizes (within 10% variation)",
            "Avoid any shadows or lighting effects",
            "Keep object details clear but minimal"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Historical Note
- This work was conducted when planning to process 2000 samples
- Methodology was later refined to 400 samples with 10 specific styles
- While superseded by Phase 2, this work informed the final methodology
- Files maintained for research documentation and transparency
